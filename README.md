# Pokemon
#
# This repo contains three files. Pokemon.py, Pokedex_scape.py, and Pokedex.csv
# Pokedex_scrape.py scrapes https://pokemondb.net for Pokemon names and a list of their moves.
# Then writes a .csv file that can be read into other programs.
# Pokemon.py reads in a .csv file with Pokemon names and a list of moves. Then randomly selects a opponent and allows the user to choose or randomize their pokemon selection. Then the Pokemon have a text-based battle.
# Both of these programs are highly adaptable to write and read different .csv files.
